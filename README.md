## Overview:
The Note Master provides a simple to use interface to both create and delete notes!  After a note is saved the note will be displayed on the screen as well as be sent to a JSON file so even after changing pages on the app the note will remain there until it is manually deleted.  This was primarily accomplished using an express server with get, post, and delete requests.

### How it works!
Using the app is very easy!  Once you are greeted with the home page simply click the get started button and start creating notes.  Once a note is saved it will be displayed on the left side of the page.  If you want to delete a note click the garbage can attatched to it.
